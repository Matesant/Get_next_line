        The objective of this project is to create a function in the C language that, when called, returns a line.

As the second project within the common core at √âcole 42,
this assignment focuses on deepening our understanding of malloc,
free, open, and read functions. Specifically, the goal is to implement the 'get_next_line' function,
which reads a text until it encounters a newline character '\n' and then returns the read line.
    </pre>
</div>


## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Using it in your code**

To use the function in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "get_next_line.h"
```
üìã Testing
To use the get_next_line function, you need to create a main function and pass a valid file descriptor (FD) to it. Then, compile your code, optionally specifying the BUFFER_SIZE:

```shell
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -o get_next_line && ./get_next_line
```
Explanation:

- -Wall -Werror -Wextra: Enable all warnings and treat them as errors.
- -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx: Define the BUFFER_SIZE macro (replace xx with the desired buffer size).
- -o get_next_line: Name the output file get_next_line.
- -/get_next_line: Execute the compiled program.

Or you can also use this third party tester to fully test the project
