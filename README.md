<h1>✅ Get_next_line</h1>

>The objective of this project is to create a function in the C language that, when called, returns a line.

```asciidoc
As the second project within the common core at École 42,
this assignment focuses on deepening our understanding of malloc,
free, open, and read functions. Specifically, the goal is to implement the 'get_next_line' function,
which reads a text until it encounters a newline character '\n' and then returns the read line.
